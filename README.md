This repository is to provide the results in "Perspectives on peak liquid manure temperature with implications for methane emissions" in Journal of Environmental Quality, authored by Chih-Yu Hung, Efe Kemal Koc, Brian Grant, Ward Smith, and Andrew VanderZaag. The DOI will be provided when it is available.  

## Fig  1
**Plot MCF difference_figure 1.R** provides the script to create Figure 1. The data was from **MCF sheet_Fig 1.xlsx**. 

## Fig 2
This figure was created with script in the repository **Test-for-surface-volume-ratio** (Ottawa) and **Test-for-surface-volume-ratio-EMD** (Edmonton).  
The information about producing simulation results are in the README files of the two repository.

## Fig 3
**ratio_linear regression.R** is the script to create Figure 3. The data was from **Manure Linear Regression.csv**. More detailed information about data collection can
be found in the publication.

## Fig  4
**Plot MCF difference_figure 4.R** provides the script to create Figure 4. The data was from **MCF sheet_Fig 4.xlsx**.
